# Branching & Merging
- `git branch` → list branches
- `git branch <name>` → create new branch
- `git checkout <branch>` → switch branch
- `git checkout -b <branch>` → create & switch
- `git merge <branch>` → merge branch into current
- Fast-forward vs 3-way merge
- Resolve conflicts with editor or `git mergetool`
