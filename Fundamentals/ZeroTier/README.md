# ZeroTier Networking

ZeroTier is a software-based network hypervisor that creates secure, encrypted, peer-to-peer virtual networks.  
Think of it as a blend of a VPN and SD-WAN: it allows devices across the world (servers, PCs, VMs, IoT, containers, mobile devices) to securely communicate as if they were on the same local network.
